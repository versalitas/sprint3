# CALLBACK HELL

Refactored code with promisify (node.js util module) and async and await.
Seems to work...

Execute from a terminal initiated within the callbackHell folder.

Best Case Scenario with everything installed correctly:

````
node app.js
```

Sod's Law Scenario:

Initiate npm and install node util


```
npm init 
npm i util
node app.js
```
