## The Observer Pattern 

Observer is a __behavioral__ pattern.
This means that is concerned about __communication between objects__.

The pattern takes care of the communication between a __Subject__ (Observable / objects with methods) and multiple __observers__. The subject target is to notify observers the state changes. Observers can __subscribe__ to the subject to keep track of any change of state of the subject. Observers can __unsubscribe__ as well, stopping to watch the subject.
