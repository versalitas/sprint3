Design Patterns

The goal is to start implementing patterns for advance structures deployed when designing software.

Specific themes:

* Creational Patterns.

* Structural patterns.

* Behavioral patterns

* Practical cases of implementation of the most important patterns.

* Node Package Manager to manage packages (npm).

The projects are executed with a terminal initiated within the pertinent folder.

```
node app.js
```

If app.js doesn't run in case extrenal modules are reuiered:

#### Sod's Law Scenario

Initiate npm and install node util. 

```
npm init 
npm i util
node app.js
```
