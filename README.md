Design Patterns

The goal is to start implementing patterns for advance structures deployed when designing software.

Specific themes:

* Creational Patterns.

* Structural patterns.

* Behavioral patterns

* Practical cases of implementation of the most important patterns.

* Node Package Manager to manage packages (npm).

The projects are executed with a terminal initiated within the pertinent folder.
Best Case Scenario with everything installed correctly:
```
node app.js
```
Sod's Law Scenario:

Initiate npm and install node util. (Applies to Callback Hell, 

```
npm init 
npm i util
node app.js
```


CALLBACK HELL
Refactored code with promisify (node.js util module) and async and await. Seems to work...
Execute from a terminal initiated within the callbackHell folder.
